# Wave Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and policies for the bot. The bot provides various functionalities including command handling, message logging, and dynamic command reloading. Ensuring the security of the bot and its configuration is crucial to maintaining its integrity and the safety of the data it interacts with.

## Version Support

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v0.3.7  | :white_check_mark: |

## Bot Token Security

### Keep Your Token Secure

- **Do Not Share**: Never share your bot token or expose it publicly. Treat it like a password.
- **Environment Variables**: Store your bot token in environment variables or secure configuration files rather than hard-coding it into your botâ€™s source code. This minimizes the risk of accidental exposure.

### Regenerate Compromised Tokens

- **Immediate Action**: If you suspect that your bot token has been exposed or compromised, regenerate it immediately through the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and update your environment variables or configuration files accordingly.

## Access Control

### Restrict Bot Permissions

- **Minimum Required Permissions**: Configure your bot with the least amount of permissions necessary for its functionality. This reduces potential damage in case of a security breach.
- **Review Permissions Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust the permissions granted to your bot to ensure they are appropriate for its current tasks and operations.

### Monitor Bot Activity

- **Activity Logs**: Regularly check the activity logs of your bot to identify any unauthorized or unusual behavior. Promptly address any anomalies to mitigate potential security issues.

## Data Protection

### Handle User Data Carefully

- **Compliance**: Ensure that any user data collected or processed by your bot complies with relevant privacy laws and regulations.
- **Avoid Sensitive Data**: Avoid storing or processing sensitive user information unless absolutely necessary. If sensitive data must be stored, ensure it is encrypted.

### Use Secure Channels

- **Encrypted Communication**: Ensure that all communication between your bot and the Discord API occurs over secure, encrypted channels to protect data in transit from interception or tampering.

## Reporting Security Issues

### Report Vulnerabilities

- **Contact Information**: If you discover a security vulnerability or issue related to the bot, report it to the maintainers as soon as possible. Provide detailed information about the issue to assist with a prompt resolution.
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Follow responsible disclosure practices when reporting vulnerabilities. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before making it public.

## Additional Security Measures

- **Regular Updates**: Keep the bot and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches and updates to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Development Practices**: Adhere to best practices for secure coding and development to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities into the bot.

## Conclusion

Following these security policies helps ensure the integrity and security of your bot and the data it handles. Always remain vigilant and proactive in managing and securing your Discord bot.
